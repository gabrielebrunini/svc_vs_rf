----------

This dataset is composed of 1100 samples with 31 features each. The first column
in the dataset represents the label. There are 5 labels. The remaining columns
are numeric features, except for the last column which is categorical (with 3
categories).

The task is the following: compare the performance of a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (implemented by sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier) with that of a
Random Forest (implemented by sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier). Try to
optimize both algorithms' parameters and determine which one is best for this
dataset. At the end of the analysis, choose an algorithm and its
optimal set of parameters: this choice is written explicitly at the end of the notebook.
